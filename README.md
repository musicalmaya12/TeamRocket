#### How the application is implemented:

## Generating sentiment scores for each song in our database and saving this information for the score matching algorithm

After our database of 2000 songs was saved locally in a pickle file, we turned the file into a Pandas DataFrame and processed the lyrics for each song using Flair (https://github.com/flairNLP/flair). We created a Text Classifier and ran the lyrics for each song through the predict() function to get its' sentiment ('POSITIVE' or 'NEGATIVE') and the corresponding sentiment score (0 - 1.0). We created two new DataFrames, 'positive_df' and 'negative_df', where we split up the 'POSITIVE' labeled songs vs. the 'NEGATIVE' labeled songs. These two DataFrames contain the columns 'artiste', 'title', 'thumbnail', 'score', and 'label'. Then, we turned these two DataFrames into two new pickle files, '2000songs_negative_df.pkl' and '2000songs_positive_df.pkl', and saved them into our SongProcessor folder under our main app folder.
